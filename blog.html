				<h4>01/04/2026</h4>
				<p>A few months ago, I picked up a used fridge for my basement. While cleaning it, I became intrigued
				with one of the stickers on the fridge door. Upon looking it up, I found out that the sticker originated 
				from a coffee house in Key West and decided to keep it. Fast forward to January 4th 2026, my wife and I 
				were driving to Key West, and I had long forgotten about the sticker. About 10 minutes before arriving
				in Key West, I see a building from the corner of my eye that catches my attention, and it suddenlty hits 
				me: It's the same coffee house. I immediately turned around and picked up a new sticker for the fridge.

				<h4>12/30/2025</h4>
				<p>Today we visit the Everglades, not on a boat tour, but driving through the actual state park. Along the road
				are several stops with trails where tourists can walk on secured pathways and observe alligators. Here are two 
				alligators in the wild.

				<h4>12/29/2025</h4>
				<p>While on vacation, it is important to visit at least one laundromat. It offers a pause from
				an otherwise hectic schedule, and allows to plan for future activities. This laundromat was 
				used in a scene of the movie Stiptease starring Demi Moore.

				<h4>12/27/2025</h4>
				<p>Second day at Universal, the highlight of the day was the E.T. ride that has been opened since
				1990 and has remained unchanged since. We had lunch at the Simpson's Krusty Burger.

				<h4>12/26/2025</h4>
				<p>First day in Florida, today we go to Universal Studios and walk around my favorite part of the park: Jurassic
				Park. The visitor center is by far the coolest building in the park. We had lunch at Thunder Falls Terrace, which
				is a Jurassic Park themed restaurant. Later, I had a burger at Dino Digs.

				<h4>12/25/2025</h4>
				<p>Just landed in Orlando, Florida. We decided to have Christmas dinner at McDonald's. However, this 
				particular location is not your typical McDonald's. It is the largest Mcdonald's in the world. It is
				 a 24-hour location that also serves Pizza in addition to regular food. Merry Christmas.

				<h4>12/21/2025</h4>
				<p>We were forced to celebrate Christmas four days early since we're flying to Florida on
				Christmas day. Strangely enough, the kids didn't seem to mind. The whole event was videotaped on
				my camcorder as is tradition.

				<p>Picked up ten Disney tapes, all sealed. I put them away in the VHS cabinet, then I hung my new Shania 
				Twain poster.

				<h4>12/15/2025</h4>
				<p>The now long abandoned Sears department store still lights up at night. Sears didn't only anchor the mall,
				it anchored our hearts.

				<h4>12/10/2025</h4>
				<p>I've decided it's never too late to start learning about computers, so my assignment today is to watch the Microsoft
				Windows 95 Video Guide. Learning from Chandler and Rachel is probably easier than learning from Bill Gates himself, and
				this will help me stay in touch with new technologies.

				<p>My collection of Stussy hats. Pictured here are 3 Stussy Electric Dot SnapBack hats with contrast 
				stitching. The black one was famously featured on "The Secret World of Alex Mack", a Nickelodeon TV Show
				created in 1994 about a girl who develops super powers after getting hit by a truck full of GC-161 chemical.

				<p>My wife and I attended our son's Christmas choir concert last night, then we ordered Pizza from Gelsosomo's.

				<h4>08/11/2025</h4>
				<p>I have a sciatica from hell, an AI certification scheduled for tomorrow, a self-assesment I need to complete by the 15th, 
				and a ton of administrative tasks I have not yet started. Where is Bill Gates when you need him?</p>
			</li>

				<h4>06/07/2025</h4>
				<p>I came home today and handed my wife a gift thinking it was our anniversary. That was awkward since our anniversary 
				was actually 4 days ago.</p>

				<h4>06/06/2025</h4>
				<p>Today is national donut day, the one day out of the year where we put our differences aside for the good of the nation.
				   My son Preston surprised me with a Boston Cream donut from Dunkin' Donuts.</p>
			</li>

				<h4>06/05/2025</h4>
				<p>Went into the office today, Chicago traffic is the worst.</p>

				<p>Not feeling good today, this weather is depressing. Coincendently, the office coffee pot needs cleaning.</p>

				<h4>06/02/2025</h4>
				<p>Today was Vinny's last day of middle school which made me realize how quickly time passes.
				   That's why I've decided to dedicate this blog to my kids, Preston and Vincent, where I will keep track 
				   of major life events. So back off Zuckerberg, this site is not for sale.
