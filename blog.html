				<h4>12/10/2025</h4>
				<p>I've decided it's never too late to start learning about computers, so my assignment today is to watch the Microsoft
				Windows 95 Video Guide. Learning from Chandler and Rachel is probably easier than learning from Bill Gates himself, and
				this will help me stay in touch with with new technologies.

				<p>My collection of Stussy hats. Pictured here are 3 Stussy Electric Dot SnapBack hats with contrast 
				stitching. The black one was famously featured on "The Secret World of Alex Mack", a Nickelodeon TV Show
				created in 1994 about a girl who develops super powers after getting hit by a truck full of GC-161 chemical.

				<p>My wife and I attended our son's Christmas choir concert last night, then we ordered Pizza from Gelsosomo's. 
				A perfect night.</p>

				<h4>12/01/2025</h4>
				<p>First day of December, it is cold here in Chicago. Today also happens to be Cyber Monday which is 
				why I have decided to update this page.</p>

				<h4>08/11/2025</h4>
				<p>I have a sciatica from hell, an AI certification scheduled for tomorrow, a self-assesment I need to complete by the 15th, 
				and a ton of administrative tasks I have not yet started. Where is Bill Gates when you need him?</p>

				<h4>06/07/2025</h4>
				<p>I came home today and handed my wife a gift thinking it was our anniversary. That was awkward since our anniversary 
				was actually 4 days ago.</p>

				<h4>06/06/2025</h4>
				<p>Today is national donut day, the one day out of the year where we put our differences aside for the good of the nation.
				   My son Preston surprised me with a Boston Cream donut from Dunkin' Donuts.</p>

				<h4>06/05/2025</h4>
				<p>Went into the office today, Chicago traffic is the worst.</p>
			</li>

				<h4>06/04/2025</h4>
				<p>Not feeling good today, this weather is depressing. Coincendently, the office coffee pot needs cleaning.</p>
			</li>

				<h4>06/02/2025</h4>
				<p>Today was Vinny's last day of middle school which made me realize how quickly time passes.
				   That's why I've decided to dedicate this blog to my kids, Preston and Vincent, where I will keep track 
				   of major life events. So back off Zuckerberg, this site is not for sale.
