				<h4>02/19/2026</h4>
				<p>I bought a brand new pack of floppy disks, $9.99 for 40 disks and a 
				free case which is pretty cheap for Memorex. I use them for my Canon 
				digital camera which works with floppy disks to store pictures. A single
				disk can hold up to 30 pictures, on par with a disposable camera but with
				digital convenience.

				<p>Thinking of visiting New Mexico in the near future? Make sure to check out

				<h4>02/12/2026</h4>
				<p>I tried to recreate the legendary SimCity 2000 city "Lakeland" in SimCity 3000.
				I am not particularly happy with how it turned out. I don't know why, but it looks
				much better in SimCity 2000. Next week I will try to build Lakeland in SimCity 4.

				<p>Started a new city today, not in real life but in SimCity 2000, and I am suddenly
				reminded of the time when SimCity 2000 came out with their Urban Renewal Kit edition
				which came with a futuristic tile set. This is what the buildings looked like, it's
				pretty cool actually.

				<p>This my dog Jack "Parker" Russell. Parker loves to get treated and greeted first

				has ever seen.

				<p>It just occurred to me that my Windows XP HP Pavilion 533w I am using to update
				this page has been in service since 2002. That would make its hard drive 24 years old.
				I am not the original owner of this magnificent wonder of technology however I can't help

				electronic mails, go online, and it shows no signs of slowing.

				<h4>02/09/2026</h4>
				<p>I highly recommend this book to anyone who's ever wanted to build a web page. The
				Non-Designer's Web Book will take you through all the essentials step by step like
				how to build web pages with iFrames, GIFs, and tables, but also design tips that will make
				your web site look great. HomeSite5, which is pictured here, is a great tool to 
				build web pages, but you can also use Netscape Composer, or FrontPage 98.

				<p>What do these two items have in common? For some odd reason, no matter which

				and the CD soundtrack to Fox's hit TV show Ally McBeal. The truth is out there.

				<h4>01/27/2026</h4>
				<p>Dear Sally, I recently purchased a VHS copy of the Felicity pilot episode. Felicity
				is WB's latest Tuesday hit starring Keri Russell. Felicity Porter is a college freshman
				who followed her high school crush to NYU. My only wish is that it wasn't sealed 
				so I could watch it without guilt. The picture below was taken using my floppy disk digital
				camera.

				<h4>01/27/2026</h4>
				<p>Preston has loved playing on the Gamecube since he was little. This afternoon, we decided
				to revisit a childhood classic, and perhaps one of the worst games we ever encountered,
				Universal Studios. The gameplay is horrendous and makes no sense whatsoever, easily
				making it one of those "It's so bad, it's good" situations.

				<h4>01/21/2026</h4>
				<p>I spent some time making upgrades to my office by putting up
				drywall on the back wall behind my desk. I also hung wallpaper and 
				installed wood paneling on the lower part of the wall, otherwise known 
				as wainscoting Pictured below are the before and after.

				<p>This new year started off on the right foot. I was the only bidder on a palette of 8
				CRT TVs, winning the whole lot for $1. My son Vincent came with on the three hour drive 
				to pick them up, and we stopped at Trader Joe's on the way home. Pictured below is an awesome 
				Sharp VCR Combo that was part of the lot. It is in mint condition and will soon find its place 
				in my office.

				<h4>01/09/2026</h4>
				<p>Configuring the internet connection on Windows XP has opened so many possibilities. Not only
				did I set up my development environment on here, but I was also able to figure out how to install
				an electronic mail client. After many attempts with different softwares and email addresses, I 
				finally got it working with OE Classic and gmail. Some people wake up and read the paper, checking 
				my electronic mail on my personal computer running Windows XP is how I start my day. For internet
				browsing I use a k-meleon browser with a custom homepage I created to mirror the America Online
				56K dial-up connection screen. Every link on the homepage is fully functional, down to the search
				bar.

				<h4>01/08/2026</h4>
				<p>This is my first blog entry using my Windows XP PC. I got it working by downloading Git v2.10
				and TortoiseGit v1.7.9 which still support Windows XP. Of course, that didn't work. While I was
				able to clone the repository and commit files, the push to origin would fail. I had to generate
				an SSH key and switch the remote URL to get it to work. All new posts will be made using Windows XP.

				<h4>01/04/2026</h4>
				<p>A few months ago, I picked up a used fridge for my basement. While cleaning it, I became intrigued
				with one of the stickers on the fridge door. Upon looking it up, I found out that the sticker originated 
				from a coffee house in Key West and decided to keep it. Fast forward to January 4th 2026, my wife and I 
				were driving to Key West, and I had long forgotten about the sticker. About 10 minutes before arriving
				in Key West, I see a building from the corner of my eye that catches my attention, and it suddenlty hits 
				me: it's the same coffee house. I immediately turned around and picked up a new sticker for the fridge.

				<p>Today we visit the Everglades, not on a boat tour, but driving through the actual state park. Along the road

				<p>While on vacation, it is important to visit at least one laundromat. It offers a pause from

				used in a scene of the movie Stiptease starring Demi Moore.

				<p>First day in Florida, today we go to Universal Studios and walk around my favorite part of the park: Jurassic
				Park. The visitor center is by far the coolest building in the park. We had lunch at Thunder Falls Terrace, which
				is a Jurassic Park themed restaurant. Later, I had a burger at Dino Digs.

				<p>Just landed in Orlando, Florida. We decided to have Christmas dinner at McDonald's. However, this 
				particular location is not your typical McDonald's. It is the largest Mcdonald's in the world. It is
				 a 24-hour location that also serves Pizza in addition to regular food. Merry Christmas.
