		<p>Welcome to the Frequently Asked Questions! Here you will find detailed answers to all the questions 
		I gets asked on a daily basis.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>What is juliensworld.com?</li>
				<span class="subtext">Asked by: mulder718<br>Date: 12/15/1996</span>
				<p>Juliensworld.com is a subsidiary of JulesNet 2000 &copy;. It is an internet startup that was founded
				in 1995, in Palo Alto, CA. This website was created to showcase what JulesNet 2000 &copy; can do: build
				professional web pages with cutting edge technology such as FrontPage 98 and HTML2, and with guaranteed 
				customer satisfaction.</p>
				<br>
				
				<li>I have a web site. How can I link to juliensworld.com?</li>
				<span class="subtext">Asked by: felicity.porter@nyu.edu<br>Date: 05/30/1997</span>
				<p>If you want to link back to this web site from your own page, all you have to do is download
				a button from the <a href="./goodies.html">goodies</a> page.</p>
				
				<li>How has the dot-com bubble affected JulesNet 2000 &copy;?</li>
				<span class="subtext">Asked by: Wired Magazine<br>Date: 09/17/2001</span>
				<p>Thanks to smart leadership, JulesNet 2000 &copy; was not exposed to the dot-com bubble burst
				and has not suffered the consequences. This can be explained in part by our viable business model,
				but I would also credit our users who are not driven by profit but by a genuine desire to surf 
				the web. As a result, we are predicting JulesNet 3000 &copy; will become reality sooner than expected.</p>
				
				<li>What makes a good web site?</li>
				<span class="subtext">Asked by: GeoCities user65735421<br>Date: 04/15/1999</span>
				<p>A good web site is one that has the features its users are looking for. Here at JulesNet 2000 &copy;,
				we see a template that can be applied to any web site: a welcome page, a guest book, a links page, and
				of course a site map. If you're able to include all four of those on your web page, you have a winner.</p>
				
				<li>How do you see the internet evolving in the 21st century?</li>
				<span class="subtext">Asked by: becky855@hotmail.com<br>Date: 06/12/1999</span>
				<p>The internet superhighway found a stable business model in the late 90's, in that regard
				I do not foresee any major changes ahead. We have a mature product that will continue to 
				flourish and stay very much the same with GIFs and Flash Players front and center.</p>
				
				
				<li>Why did Keri Russell cut her hair?</li>
				<span class="subtext">Asked by: rachelgreene94@aol.com<br>Date: 08/25/1998</span>
				<p>No comment!</p>
