		<p>Welcome to the Frequently Asked Questions! Here you will find detailed answers to all the questions 
		I gets asked on a daily basis.</p>

		<div class="inner-content">
			<ul>
				<li>Can you run to the car and grab my purse?</li>
				<span class="subtext">Asked by: Wife<br>Date: 12/15/2024</span>
				<p>Yes, I can go grab your purse that you left in the car knowing full well that you were going
				to need it later. It also doesn't help that it's 0° outside and that your purse is probably not
				in the car anyway. Additionally, it seems your car is locked and you can't find your keys.
				</p>
				<br>
				<li>Can you make me a bagel?</li>
				<span class="subtext">Asked by: Son #1<br>Date: 12/02/2025</span>
				<p>I often get asked this question. The short answer is yes, I can. I've even remembered how my son 
				likes his bagel: blueberry bagel, almost burnt, with a generous amount of Philadephia cream cheese. 
			    He will sometimes mix things up and request stawberry cream cheese.</p>
				<br>
				<li>Can you come say goodnight?</li>
				<span class="subtext">Asked by: Son #2<br>Date: 12/05/2025</span>
				<p>Followed by "Can you get me a water?" and "Can you put my phone on the charger?". I will then be asked
				to set his alarm, turn the TV on, find the remote, find something to watch on Netflix, and turn off the light. 
				Ten requests and 30 minutes later, I finally get to say goodnight, but not before one final question, 
				"Can you close my door?".</p>
