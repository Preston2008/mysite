		<p>Welcome to the Frequently Asked Questions! Here you will find detailed answers to all the questions 
		I gets asked on a daily basis.</p>

		<div class="inner-content">
			<ul>
				<li>Can you run to the car and grab my purse?</li>
				<span class="subtext">Asked by: Wife<br>Date: 12/15/2024</span>
				<p>Yes, I can go grab your purse that you left in the car knowing full well you were going
				to need it later. It also doesn't help that it's 0° outside and that your purse is probably not
				in the car anyway. Bonus points if your car is locked and you can't find the keys.
				</p>
				<br>
				<li>Can you make me a bagel?</li>
				<span class="subtext">Asked by: Son #1<br>Date: 12/02/2025</span>
				<p>I often get asked this question. The short answer is yes, I can. I've even memorized how my son 
				likes his bagel: blueberry bagel, almost burnt, with a generous amount of Philadephia cream cheese. 
			    He will sometimes mix things up and request stawberry cream cheese.</p>
				<br>
				<li>Can you come say goodnight?</li>
				<span class="subtext">Asked by: Son #2<br>Date: 12/05/2025</span>
				<p>Followed by "Can you get me a water?" and "Can you put my phone on the charger?". I will then be asked
				to set his alarm, turn the TV on, find the remote, find something to watch on Netflix, and turn off the light. 
				Ten requests and 30 minutes later, I finally get to say goodnight, but not before one final question, 
				"Can you close my door?".</p>
				<br>
				<li>Do you get paid this week?</li>
				<span class="subtext">Asked by: Wife, Son #1 & Son #2<br>Date: Every other week</span>
				<p>If I had a dollar for every time someone asked me this question, payday wouldn't matter
				as much. Yes, we're in the second week of the pay period, and yes, we all have items in our Amazon
				cart. That's the struggle we must face when getting paid biweekly. I hear in some countries, people
				only get paid once a month. But have no worries kids, payday is at most only 13 days away.</p>
				<br>
				<li>Do you have beer?</li>
				<span class="subtext">Asked by: Uncle Alex<br>Date: Every Sunday during Football seson</span>
				<p>Dear Uncle Alex, yes I have beer. In fact I keep the basement fridge stocked up just for you. Should you have
				another? Probably not, but that question did not make the FAQ list. So grab a beer, and enjoy the Bears 
				game, they're having a great season this year. PS: when you go to the bar after the game, remember to grab
				your $200 heated jacket before you go home.</p>
				<br>
				<li>Can you Zelle me $10?</li>
				<span class="subtext">Asked by: Niece #1<br>Date: Once a month</span>
				<p>The downside of having nieces and nephews who think money grows on trees. Sometimes I feel more like
				a bank than a human being, but I know it's money well spent. This time, I am told the money will go to
				something truly essential: Dunkin' Donuts. I am always eager to find places to invest my money
				with guaranteed zero return, so I comply with the request. Enjoy your iced coffee!</p>
				<br>
				<li>Can you help me bring all this stuff from my car inside your house?</li>
				<span class="subtext">Asked by: Aunt Kimberly<br>Date: Every Holiday</span>
				<p>Ah, the holidays. Nothing pleases me more than to carry a pile of junk inside my freshly cleaned house. Sure, I spent most
				of the past two days deep cleaning and preparing for the occasion, but I don't see anything wrong with
				making a last minute gigantic mess before all the guests arrive.</p>
