				<p>Man who suddenly passed away worries about losing his individuality once informed crossing over means being part of a single entity.</p>
				
				<p>What does it mean to be an individual? In the U.S., we are taught from a young age to cherish 
				our individuality, for it is what makes us unique, and special. As we grow up, our various experiences 
				and encounters shape our personality to encompass a wide array of beliefs, tastes, and values. What if 
				everything that made you "you" disappeared overnight? That's exaclty what happened to Peter Denslow on
				a fateful night of July.
				</p>
				
				<p>The year was 2025. Peter had just gotten home from his computer engineering job at Intel. 
				While he was generally considered successful by his peers, Peter led a typical average American 
				life by all accounts. In his late thirties, Peter owned a home, was married with 2 kids, and
				even had a dog and a cat. This type of life in the suburbs has a way of forcing conformity on its
				residents, but not Peter. Peter had known very early on who he was, and never pretended to be anything
				else. In fact, Peter was so uniquely different that he had never felt like he belonged anywhere. 		
				Peter love many things, but above all he loved his country. After all, it was his country that allowed 
				him to be an individual, and he was well aware of that. His patriotism was made especially obvious 
				every July when the time came to celebrate our independence.				
				</p>
				
				<p>
				</p>
				
				<p>Peter found himself alone in an unfamiliar setting. He looked around but all he saw was
				a vast emptiness. The ground looked natural with some kind of grass on it. The sky was the blackest
				grey. What was this place? Could he have died from his injuries? Walking around, looking for any 
				sign of familiarity, Peter started investigating his new situation. He picked apart every detail of 
				this strange place, was there really grass on the ground? What was the "ground" made of?
				Peter, like most of us, had learned about the afterlife through religion although he had never 
				formally accepted it as the definitive answer on the subject.
				</p>
				
				<p>That's when a shadowy figure appeared in the horizon. Unphased, Peter stood his ground.
				The figure as getting closer when finally it was just a few feet away from him. Peter saw 
				an opportunity and started asking questions. He shouted "What is this place?" but got no answer.
				The strange being communicated through non verbal means that Peter had passed away and must
				now cross over. "Cross over to where?" Peter asked. The being replied telepathically that every
				human comes from a single divine entity, and that they each must rejoin it once they pass. 
				Perplexed, Peter asked what does that mean to be part of an enity, will he still be alive, will he 
				still be himself?
				</p>
				
				<p>
				If this life was nothing more than a simulation, why does the entity need his knowledge?
				Would you stand at the gates of heaven and proclaim your right to remain an individual?
				</p>
