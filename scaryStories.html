				<p>This web page in no way aims at discrediting any personal experiences with near death
				encounters. Its goal is to use critical thinking and analytical skills to ask the questions
				no one else is willing to ask.</p>
				
				<p>NDEs are a fascinating subject that deserves a lot more attention than it gets. 
				While there has been a significant amount of research in the scientific community,
				the mainstream on the other hand has mainly placed NDEs in the same categories as
				UFO sightings. I have read many NDE accounts over the years, and I will list here the
				recurring themes I have encountered. Then I will elaborate on each theme and point out
				inexplicable contradictions.</p>
				
				<p>Recurring themes found in NDEs:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>We choose our lives beforehand</li>
					<li>We are here to learn, to complete a mission</li>
					<li>Shortly after passing, we are met by a relative</li>
					<li>There is an immutable plan at play</li>
					<li>The NDE can be either positive or negative</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4>1.We choose our lives beforehand</h4>
				
				<p>This is a scary thought and I will explain why.
				A common theme is how we chose our lives from the afterlife (or in this case 
				"beforelife"?) based on a specific set of experiences that must be learned. 
				In some accounts, patients have reported learning that we even choose whom
				we are born to.</p>
				
				<p>This strongly implies, and has even been said, that the event of our lives have already
				occurred. So here is the terrifying question no one has asked: if all the events that
				make up my life have already occurred and my life has already been lived, who lived it?</p>
				
				<p>If I am able to choose a specific life, and I can see exactly how it will unfold, then
				the actions and events must have already happened at some point. In order for that to
				be true, one must conclude that a life has already been lived before a soul jumps in.</p>
				
				<p>This begs another question: does the soul not have any impact on its life on earth? 
				If you know beforehand what will happen, then you are by definition unable to change it.
				That would mean that the soul is but a spectator in its human life. So who are we? Are we
				our soul, or are we the vessel through which the soul learns what it needs to learn?</p>
				
				<p>Demographics may offer the strongest argument against this claim. How can we possibly choose
				our lives, when birthrates dictate where souls would be needed? If we believe every human 
				has a soul, then we must also believe that for some unknown reason, the majority of souls
				choose to go to Africa.</p>
				
				<p>There is of course another possibility. What instances do we know of where one can choose
				a predefined life that was never lived? A character in a video game would fit this criteria.
				You power on your game system, pick a game, and in that game you pick a character that follows
				a programmed story. That story is written, but is not "lived" until a player selects it.</p>
				
				<p>Either way, this has grave implications for our lives here on earth. We either have no control
				on our destiny whatsoever, or we are in an advanced simulation.</p>
				
				<h4>2.We are here to learn</h4>
				
				<p>Let's assume for the sake of the argument that we did have choose this life from another
				realm, and that we did so because we needed to learn from specific experiences. What can
				we possibly learn in this life that will be of any use in the afterlife?</p>
				
				<p>Are we here to learn about love and empathy? Surely those two things already exist in the
				afterlife. Why come here and learn about suffering if there is no suffering in the next
				realm? If the afterlife was so perfect, there would be no need to come here in the first place.
				In fact, some cases have reported the feeling of getting the entire knowledge of the universe
				instantly uploaded into their afterlife brain. I do not see how both can be true, that on one
				hand, we need to come here to learn, but on the other, we can have instant access to all knowledge.</p>
				
				<p>We are in effect saying that in order to have a fuller life in the afterlife, we must come
				here on earth and learn the human way of life, only to go back and live a non-human life. Why
				isn't anyone else seeing this paradox? Even in the event that we were indeed here to learn about 
				those emotions, I hardly see this life on Earth as the most practical way to do it.</p>
				
				<p>But what if? Let's try to see this from another perspective. What if as humans, we could
				choose to experience life as a different specie? What would we learn from living as an insect
				for short while, then going back to being human? I see a few possibilities where this could be
				useful, mainly for science. We might also grow a new found appreciation for our lives as humans.
				While this is possible, this would also imply life on earth is not special at all, and is actually
				considered a lower life form.</p>
				
				<p>If we assume this is true then here is the frightening part: you do not leave heaven, a place 
				that knows no suffering, for earth unless it is seen as either a science experiment or some form 
				of punishment.</p>
				
				<p>Lastly, to further complicate things, we may also be here to complete a mission, except we have 
				no idea what we're here to learn or accomplish. Similarly with the so called mission, I have to ask, 
				what could we possibly do on earth that has any impact whatsoever on an afterlife where we live as light 
				beings? While good decisions have a positive impact here on earth for ourselves, and future generations, 
				they are limited in scope. Paying for someone's Starbucks at the drive-thru may be considered good, but 
				cannot possibly make sense for anyone in the afterlife. That would be like asking the Sims to be good and 
				thinking it has an impact on reality.</p>
				
				<h4>3.We are met by relatives</h4>
				
				<p>I will keep this one short because it is pretty much self explanatory. People who have experienced NDEs 
				almost always describe an encounter with a deceased relative. If we choose our lives beforehand, and have 
				done so multiple times, are we really related to anyone in the afterlife in the same sense we are on earth? 
				Here is the guy who chose to be my father on earth, but now he's a ball of light. If all those memories of 
				our previous lives became accessible during an NDE, I would think it would be awkward more than anything, "Wow,
				we were just pretending this whole time?".</p>
				
				<h4>4.There is an immutable plan at play</h4>
				
				<p>This particular argument could also be made with Religious texts. "God has a plan". Everything
				in our lives has been carefully planned, down to the minute. Except now, you are experiencing
				an NDE in which you are told that your death wasn't planned. </p>

				<p>This is another recurring theme of NDEs, you die only to be told it is not your time.
				So which one is it? How can our lives be planned and at the same time contain unplanned 
				events which are themselves caused by a tedious series of supposedly "planned" events? Was
				the NDE part of the plan? It seems to be in direct contradiction with the first paragraph.
				If we chose our lives, and they're so carefully crafted, then an NDE would not be necessary.
				If on the other hand, it was not a planned event, then our lives are not written in advance.
				In any case, both propositions cannot be true.</p>
				
				<h4>5.The NDE can be either positive or negative</h4>
				
				<p>NDE accounts report different experiences when it comes to being judged on what we have 
				accomplished here on earth. Some say there is no judgement, we were simply here to learn.
				Others have terrifying and unsettling accounts of encountering a place similar to what we
				think of as "hell". Those encounters seemingly come with no explanation or judgement.</p>
				
				<p>What does that imply? If we are to believe it at face value, it implies something very absurd:
				the American justice system is somehow more fair than the afterlife. Are we to believe that
				such a complex realm, that somehow put our whole universe into existence, but also asked
				souls to come to earth to live a predefined life, would condemn us to eternity in hell
				without the possibility of defending ourselves? Moreover, why would we choose a life that guarantees 
				an eternity in hell?</p>
				
				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				
				<p>While we cannot possibly know for certain what happens when we die, we should use critical thinking
				when presented with options. Unlike religion, NDEs have no agenda. People who have experienced them
				simply tell us what they saw without forcing any one to believe. The question is not so much if those
				stories are made up - I don't believe they are, but rather, are they real experiences at all?</p>
				
				<p>Science argues that the brain will release certain chemicals at the time of death which
				may be responsible for NDEs. However, I don't think that this alone would account for the remarkable
				consistency throughout many accounts.</p>
				
				<p>Nevertheless, a simple exercise in logic reveals NDEs are full contradictions. It is possible that
				they are all true and that we simply cannot understand how the afterlife operates. In any case, 
				we should not stop asking questions, and we should not be afraid to go looking for answers.</p>
