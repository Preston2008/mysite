				<p>This web page in no way aims at discrediting any personal experiences with near death
				encounters. Its goal is to use critical thinking and analytical skills to ask the questions
				no one else is willing to ask.</p>
				
				<p>NDEs are a fascinating subject that deserves a lot more attention than it get. 
				While there has been a significant amount of research in the scientific community,
				the mainstream on the other hand has mainly placed NDEs in the same categories as
				UFO sightings. I have read many NDE stories over the years, and I will list here the
				recurring themes I have encountered. Then I will elaborate on each theme and point out
				inexplicable contradictions.</p>
				
				<p>Recurring themes found in NDEs:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>We choose our lives beforehand</li>
					<li>We are here to learn, to complete a mission</li>
					<li>Shortly after passing, we are met by a relative</li>
					<li>There is an immutable plan at play</li>
					<li>The NDE can be either positive or negative</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4>1.We choose our lives beforehand</h4>
				
				<p>This is a scary thought and I will explain why.
				A common theme is how we chose our lives from the afterlife (or in this case 
				"beforelife"?) based on a specific set of experiences that must be learned. 
				In some accounts, patients have reported learning that we even choose whom
				we are born to.</p>
				
				<p>This strongly implies, and has even been said, that the event of our lives have already
				occurred. So here is the terrifying question no one has asked: if all the events that
				make up my life have already occurred and my life has already been lived, who lived it?</p>
				
				<p>If I am able to choose a specific life, and I can see exactly how it will unfold, then
				the actions and events must have already happened at some point. In order for that to
				be true, one must conclude that a life has already been lived before a soul jumps in.</p>
				
				<p>This begs another question: does the soul not have any impact on its life on earth? 
				If you know beforehand what will happen, then you are by definition unbale to change it.
				That would mean that the soul is but a spectator in its human life. So who are we? Are we
				our soul, or are we the vessel through which the soul learns what it needs to learn?</p>
				
				<p>There is of course another possibility. What instances do we know of where one can choose
				a predefined life that was never lived? A character in a video game would fit this criteria.
				You power on your game system, pick a game, and in that game you pick a character that follows
				a programmed story. That story is written, but is not "lived" until a player selects it.</p>
				
				<p>Either way, this has grave implications for our lives here on earth. We either have no control
				on our destiny whatsover, or we are in an advanced simulation.</p>
				
				<h4>1.We are here to learn</h4>
				
				<p>Let's assume for the sake of the argument that we did have choose this life from another
				realm, and that we did so because we needed to learn from specific experiences. What can
				we possibly learn in this life that will be of any use in the afterlife?</p>
				
				<p>Are we here to learn about love and empathy? Surely those two things already exist in the
				afterlife. Why come here and learn about suffering if there is no suffering in the next
				realm? If the afterlife was so perfect, there would be no need to come here in the first place.</p>
